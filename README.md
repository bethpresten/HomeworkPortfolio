# HomeworkPortfolio

Description:
This application was modified from a former application. I created a skeleton portfolio based on the skills that I had at that point. This application is now fully descriptive and functioning with a full biography, personalized touches with fonts, screenshots of projects and assignments, and a functioning form.

Three separate html pages comprise the portfolio: an index/about, contact, and portfolio page.

Index.html: The index page is where general information can be found.

Portfolio.html: The portfolio page is where project information and brief descriptions can be found.

Contact.html: The contact is where a contact form as well as direct contact information can be found.
